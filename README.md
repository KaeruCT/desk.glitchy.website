# desk.glitchy.website

A nostalgic (and not very faithful) recreation of the Windows 7 desktop UI.

See [CREDITS.txt](./src/CREDITS.txt) for more information about specific applications.

The code is intentionally not too polished, as this is a project I work on for fun.

Things might be buggy but that's part of the fun.

You WILL find weird hacks and work-arounds and lots of inefficients stuff.
