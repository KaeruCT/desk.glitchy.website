import markov from "markov";

const lines = `We're all chemicals, vitamins and minerals
Vicodin with inner tubes, wrapped around the arm
To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
Top Cat chat, let's begin another yarn
That's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm'
But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy
So what powers cowards to get them to the top
Just to fall asleep listening to Bach?
The ribbon in the sky is the ribbon that I drop
Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
That lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading
They catch chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?
And what's the talking without the match feeling?
As buried living and cherry picking
Every linen from your berry system
Then proceed with the pack feeding
When I was young I had visions of another world
Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother HuRl
Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
I like my pancakes cut in swirls
Morrocan moles and undercover squirrels
I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons
Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms
Apologize for my weird mix
What taste like hot dogs and tear drips
And looks like pantomime and clear bricks
And smells like shotguns and deer piss
They on their hunt, kinda salty that I'm going hard
First part of a party, that I throw in parts
One minute you playing pool, next minute you throwing darts
But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars
I run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards
From popular mechanics to overdosing hearts
Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
Nerd game make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Backup the word play playin' at the man's states
Mean I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when the man brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face
My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base
The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine
That hovers above cities like weather men
And maybe weather woman
Whatever better to tell ya weather comin'
I prefer girls to reign all over the world
And not rain like, rain man or rain like rain dance
Or rain like a slight chance of rain when it's raining
Or rein like deer slaves to Santa Claus sleigh man
But reign like Queens that reign over made man
And not Queen like Queen killer, rhapsody bohemian Queen
But Queen like white glove wave hand
And not wave hand like it's a heat wave
So you make a fan by waving your hand
I'm talking wave like you saying "hey"
Man, and not hay for horses and hoarse like you almost voiceless
You gotta treat your vocal chords like it's a fortress
And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
And especially when you're recording
Cause that's the portion that's important
When I was reporting that I was poor
But now I'm more than
It's still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
Crying shames, make margarita rims from cheap tops
Deep plots in floor, the ceiling windows for my peep pots
A little scene with the sickle swings to make the wheat drop
And a hundred words for them hummingbirds that like to eavesdrop
And fan out like peacocks with a parakeet that beat box
So the sun rise when the beat drops
And the sun dies when the beat stops
Then it unties, then it relocks
Then it relapsed, then it detox
Then heat back like a heat pack
On his knee caps of the weak spot
Cause he want what we got, like yeah
Then forge poetry like a young honory Morrissey
Then spit it to the golden locks thots
Who like their porridge all watery
Not scorching nor sorbity
From the steel orbitings, sorcerer, sorcery
Coming down gorgeously, just like a Stacey Dash waterfall
A more torturing, a water boarding Barbie doll
A river of women like a Brazilian Carnival
Swimming in feminine bikinis made out of barbasol
Somebody give them the volleyballs
If you love her, don't ever send her to Mally Mall's
Homie if she lonely she might end up in Macauly's claws
Coming out the closet over goblets down at Madri Gras
The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call
My reposition was black condition of activism
Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems
But they not after listens, unless it's dropping on Activision
Are we apps or are we bodies filled with apparitions
Operating applications, stuck inside a Apple prison
Chicken hack and download updates that lack religion
Or are we more, than soil tainting, disloyal changelings
Preoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing
And foiling other's royal saintings?
I sit back and watch the world through the eye holes in my oil paintings
Uh!
Ain't nothin' to it but to do it
Unless you Virgin Mary, nothin' do it but the truest
Believe all that unless you Jewish
Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus
And I feel like a missionary to a clitoris
The water bearer heir of traditions that I swear to never change
My chair position or conditions of my porridge
Submission for sedition against the religion of a chorus
Keep them golden weave thieves out the motherfuckin' forest
As I perform a nerve storm
I prefer my pictures in word form
Bury the hatchet like how a bird born
As I paint cold pictures like Kool-Aid facing condensation
Having conversations with flavorful combinations
Slave to my concentration
So that's OJ The Juiceman meets OJ with two hands
And two gloves, that's too snug
To judge who was, who drew blood
And, Lupe look at all these toucans
In a cemetery full of tomahawkes
Giving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults
Road runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across
Anomalies by the colonies flukes by the reservoir
Wildin' pursuers end up as poofs on the desert floor
Levitating youth so know the truth of where the fountain hides
Bucaraa Roof painting tunnels onto the mountain sides
A thousands parts a pound of heart an ounce of eyes
Announcing now the doubt in mouth pronounces a count of lies
Chocula Counts by the counts of 5, refrigerator roof full of animals and monsters
Incinerated shoes and the manual for contra
Assorted memories from my childhood
Absorbing energy from the wild woods
Electronic combat Konami sign contract
Chinese char killing cucarachas on contact
Chicago spread an aficionado
Efficient spitting bridging divisions is in Chicano
Who's the Boss? If isn't Alyssa Milano
Dudikoff, ninja mission into the Congo
Polarize envy of the older guys
Black obi, shinobi hittin' Kenno in the face with all my throwin' knives
Sub-zero guiding, hiding, riding in the pack as well
Sound village, Leaf village, wolf spirit, magic spells
Dodging rain and catching hail
Faces need samurais to catch the L
Special research vessels made for catching whales
Fillet-a-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails
Rewrite history, liberty needs a better bell
Maybe hotter irons and carbon fibres that never fail
Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairytale
Or maybe just a metal pail that you hit with a steel tools
To announce that you've had enough and dropping out of SEAL school
Just like trout jumping out they house to let they gills cool
Cuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool
I said it feels cool to kill fools
Slipping through the cracks like when you trying to grill gruel
Take no Viking water bottle and not following pill rules
Will have you off of the throttle when you should be modelin' chill mood
Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin' wheel shoes
Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
Oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your meal you
Simple as a Buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot, practising stillness
Real still til he realizes his realness
Defeat Samsara achieves nirvana and brilliance, yea
Suspect guyss don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Said I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit
Suspect guyss don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit
Started blazing and stargazing
See how you can reach your farthest aspirations
It's like holy matrimony in The Matrix
It ain't shit, they just call it a strange shift
Cold feet cause I'm on thin ice
It's alright besides the fact I want it all in one night
Like, you can't skip steps is the best
Even though the vets hold a .47 with a vest
Now that's a wise investment
Or a concept to try and hide divine intentions
It's like, let em hate, stay calm and meditate
When life has the lemons it's time to eliminate
More sour than lemonade, anyways
Different days, different highs, different haze
Kama Sutra with miss Mary Jane
And the karma suits her, she a vibrant thang
You guyss is suspect and I'm just a ruffneck
That wasn't breaking pencil tips when I would bust lead
I puff meds and leave chumps fed and punks dead
Her cunt wet she getting rough sex no sunset
I like a chick with a buck tooth yeah it could get fucked too
We keep one eye open they sus too
Never tell em my government make any covenant bitches be loving it
Say not to put a glove on it some funny shit

I feed lines to felines just to get up in their tummies quick
Yeah you got tricks but I got five more
So any game you try to play you better know I got the high score
You better settle down cause you not on my level now
The Pros is semi-circle they can tell the world you get around
Some guyss clowns what's the shit about
They used to doubt now they see us sprout and I'm out
When I was thirteen I was bad, rapping about guns we never had
Now we smoke raws with filter tips, old homies talking shit
Said you was best of mine but you stay plotting on that dime
Thought cause we was cool before that we gon' take yo ass on tour fuck nah
This my chance to get it
How you entitled to my shine, guys you ain't help me get it
Now these guyss see me getting it, check the statements on my debit
My profile get requested but I never hit accept
Hit the sour to the chest, I reflect
When I was fourteen, up late, eyes glued to the sampler screen
Eyes beam, cause we can make it better
Smoking on that Jack Herer, welcome to the Progressive Era
And brains don't matter
But tell me what really matters when you pissed off at the world
Like you got a crazy bladder and
Momma always said that shit don't come on silver platters
So I gather my thoughts
And make use of all these synonyms
Cause I could never swallow the truth
Like it's cinnamon
Excuse me if I'm militant the sinning men in my hood
Could leave a guys quivering like goddamn
Deliver him the venom and his liver is corrupting all his ligaments
Now he's at a standstill so tell me if he'll live again
The fire in his heart, still seem to be simmering
Now take that little simmer and turn it into adrenaline
Penicillin could not stop the drive he be giving em like
Mad fours (Fords) and fast forward let's get to the part where his records
Could 'ford him a couple Fords like Lord
Ain't he gifted, Christmas just doesn't fit him
I need my own holiday and by the way
I'mma possibly own Monopoly and all McDonald's property
Cause I won't live in poverty like
In the clouds come and find me son, I'm flier than Hermione
Homie tripping got em sounding like Hansen in the nineties
Charlie Manson your whole body cause that damage in your party
Can you manage what I'm dishing out, go get your wishing count
You sell me something then I flip that amount
I just switched that account, get that profit then I'm out yeah
They all wonder but it's Nyck bitch don't doubt
Rip your lips off your mouth
Man I'm violent ring the siren with these bars I'm reciting
Cars with no license
Hard man, I'm feeling like a spartan with a trident damn
Picture perfect, bet I'll make that picture worth it
I'll be doubling my spot, no Louisiana purchase
So declare that, with my hair back
You want a fair one, catch a fair smack
I hunt up on my prey
So pray I ain't hunting on your ass today, like be afraid
Cool cuts flow, the deli can't touch this
Slipping like fishes, choking when you hit the cypher
And I ain't talking weed smoke but I let the weed blow
Anything just let the leaves know, oh
Sucka's fuck around, get clapped where you rest at
guys saying you cracking, fire break you imagination ask your lady
It's assassin when I come up on the track
It's a curse that I always try to find sex in these verses
But I got your attention, it's part of my ascension
But if I keep toking this strain is gonna leave me stranded
In this dimension, or to mention
guyss is snitching, might charge me with battery
But fuck that cause piss was never in your anatomy
So don't try to lie on a guys that got mine on my third eye shit
Man I'm on my higher degrees without my masters
I could use my words to urge into disasters
guyss wanna know how my wheels keep on spinning
And they see we getting love cause they see the pros is winning
Cause we giving love back so they peeping how we fitting
Ain't gonna have no sus guys stepping to me
I like to keep my chakras open so respect my G
I got the bush going in, repping FPT
So sus guyss watch your back pros next to me
I got Chuck on the team to collect the green
And show these suspect guyss what it mean to scheme
Another Apex predator crushing your dreams
Gonna get your wig pushed back between my cream
Taking all you sus guyss throw you out the scene
I'm taking all you sus guyss throw you out the scene
Taking all you sus guyss throw you out the scene
The P the R the O the Dette
Never am I vexed, I'm always calm, cool, collect
Unless you disrespect, I wreck you verbally
So expect the worst from me, I beck you with my intellect
You best be circumspect check, made you making all the wrong moves
Do I intimidate you or more infuriate you
Cause I annihilate all who participating for the gold
Lovers I decapitate with everything I say, see
Come sneak a peak and, tell me what you peeping
Then struggle to say it ain't greatness that you seeing
It is what here sits in the midst of us, yeah it's quite mysterious
No you're not delirious, I'm serious it's clear to us
Add some crystals gonna see gold then platinum
Seen it on some tarots before, so I know how it is all gonna go down
Gotta go more uptown, more in the cloud
Cause didn't ya know by now, I'm skyline bound
And my time's now, I don't graze ground, I'm new in your town
So assume what you please but you don't know me
Say what you please but you don't know T'nah
Who that mofo who came to show boat just cause he float like no other
Style smooth as butter and slick like lubricant rubbers
So going in on tracks ain't a real test, the real quest
Is making real tracks with feelings, people ain't feel yet
Dessy be that suspect for subjects for all the records
Set in for all the records, I spit in a split of seconds
So you can't reckon that I wasn't checking for beats unpleasant
I eat up a track and hit your producer up for seconds
Remember I'm the face so lace me in the line
The bars that I could line up could probably bump the fine up
Define what never can judge, rap is in my blood
So much, my capularies adapted a sanctuary
From the 5th of January, every punchline turned into crunch time
Was cutting records more times than my school's lunch line
So if this hits mine, go ahead and pop your wrist fine
Been spitting dirty, the vocals recording spit shine
'Til the day I die, I'll be puffing lye, fuck the world, fuck it dry
Tell them government spies I won't cover my eyes
Won't cower, won't move cause I don't move like a coward
Knowledge is power and the flower of life is (s)ours
Get as high as ours, maybe you could see the towers
Scour your dirty mind and maybe you unleash the power
We all got the potential in our body and soul, probably you know
I found mines right through the pencil, started bodying flows but fuck that
This be the preview of primeval hip-hop retrieval
I hold illegal like them coppers hold weasels to squeal
This one for my people, headed to the top, no redo
Thinking up evil but see no evil just be knievel
I ain't ask to be this good, they just made me better
They told me cheese at the cams and they made me cheddar
And the green only made me clever
See God made three Bigs, two Pacs, but he only made one error
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Ayo, Bo knows this And Bo knows that
But Bo don't know jack, 'cause Bo can't rap
Well, what do you know? The Di-Dawg is first up to bat
No batteries included and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move-fakin'
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe, so
Sleep if you want, Nytol will help you get your Zs, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short, dark, and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here
My days of paying dues are over, acknowledge me as in there
Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meaning from the get-go
Sit back, relax, and let yourself go
Don't sweat what you heard, but act like you know
Watch; as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come, rewind
Powerful impact from the cannon!
Not bragging, tryna read my mind, just imagine
Vocabulary's necessary
When diggin' into my library
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Eating Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Unh! Unh! Unh! All over the track, man
Unh, pardon me, unh! As I come back!
As I did it, yo, I had to beg your pardon
When I travel through the town I roll with the squadron
Rawr! Rawr! Like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers 'cause your pants were saggin'
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling rank like some old, stale urine
Chickity Choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, buttcheeks, they were kicking
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync, the rhymes are on time
Rippin' up the sound just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
Yeah, my man, mothafucka!
Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Uhm—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and guys swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good guy's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a guy say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy
Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack guy with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for guys more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my guys with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich guy problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me!
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money!
Big, big money
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker!
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
Not for nothing, I've foreseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of autumn
All them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport, they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning
This week has been a bad massage, I need a happy ending
And a new beginning and a new fitted
And some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied 'til all my guys get it, get it?
Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they'd try to crack me if they ever see a Black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a guy ain't shootin' a jumpshot, runnin' a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the world's games, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up off of this dick
And these drugs, guys can't resist it
Remind me when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest, guy, I must have missed it
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, "Take them glasses off and get in the pool"
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a Black Beatle anyway, a fuckin' roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fuckin' coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffin' coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it, I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it?
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to blackball me
Forgot about two things, my Black balls
I done copped Timbs, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots, and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag', a Louis bag, grabbin' a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buyin' sweats, running up in Stetson
guy hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black Dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye
