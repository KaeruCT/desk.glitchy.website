import markov from "markov";
const lines = `We're all chemicals, vitamins and minerals
Vicodin with inner tubes, wrapped around the arm
To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
Top Cat chat, let's begin another yarn
That's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm'
But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy
So what powers cowards to get them to the top
Just to fall asleep listening to Bach?
The ribbon in the sky is the ribbon that I drop
Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
That lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading
They catch chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?
And what's the talking without the match feeling?
As buried living and cherry picking
Every linen from your berry system
Then proceed with the pack feeding
When I was young I had visions of another world
Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother HuRl
Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
I like my pancakes cut in swirls
Morrocan moles and undercover squirrels
I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons
Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms
Apologize for my weird mix
What taste like hot dogs and tear drips
And looks like pantomime and clear bricks
And smells like shotguns and deer piss
They on their hunt, kinda salty that I'm going hard
First part of a party, that I throw in parts
One minute you playing pool, next minute you throwing darts
But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars
I run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards
From popular mechanics to overdosing hearts
Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
Nerd game make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Backup the word play playing at the man's states
Mean I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when the man brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face
My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base
The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine
That hovers above cities like weather men
And maybe weather woman
Whatever better to tell ya weather coming
I prefer girls to reign all over the world
And not rain like, rain man or rain like rain dance
Or rain like a slight chance of rain when it's raining
Or rein like deer slaves to Santa Claus sleigh man
But reign like Queens that reign over made man
And not Queen like Queen killer, rhapsody bohemian Queen
But Queen like white glove wave hand
And not wave hand like it's a heat wave
So you make a fan by waving your hand
I'm talking wave like you saying hey
Man, and not hay for horses and hoarse like you almost voiceless
You gotta treat your vocal chords like it's a fortress
And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
And especially when you're recording
Cause that's the portion that's important
When I was reporting that I was poor
But now I'm more than
It's still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
Crying shames, make margarita rims from cheap tops
Deep plots in floor, the ceiling windows for my peep pots
A little scene with the sickle swings to make the wheat drop
And a hundred words for them hummingbirds that like to eavesdrop
And fan out like peacocks with a parakeet that beat box
So the sun rise when the beat drops
And the sun dies when the beat stops
Then it unties, then it relocks
Then it relapsed, then it detox
Then heat back like a heat pack
On his knee caps of the weak spot
Cause he want what we got, like yeah
Then forge poetry like a young honory Morrissey
Then spit it to the golden locks thots
Who like their porridge all watery
Not scorching nor sorbity
From the steel orbitings, sorcerer, sorcery
Coming down gorgeously, just like a Stacey Dash waterfall
A more torturing, a water boarding Barbie doll
A river of women like a Brazilian Carnival
Swimming in feminine bikinis made out of barbasol
Somebody give them the volleyballs
If you love her, don't ever send her to Mally Mall's
Homie if she lonely she might end up in Macauly's claws
Coming out the closet over goblets down at Madri Gras
The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call
My reposition was black condition of activism
Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems
But they not after listens, unless it's dropping on Activision
Are we apps or are we bodies filled with apparitions
Operating applications, stuck inside a Apple prison
Chicken hack and download updates that lack religion
Or are we more, than soil tainting, disloyal changelings
Preoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing
And foiling other's royal saintings?
I sit back and watch the world through the eye holes in my oil paintings
Uh!
Aingt nothing to it but to do it
Unless you Virgin Mary, nothing do it but the truest
Believe all that unless you Jewish
Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus
And I feel like a missionary to a clitoris
The water bearer heir of traditions that I swear to never change
My chair position or conditions of my porridge
Submission for sedition against the religion of a chorus
Keep them golden weave thieves out the motherfucking forest
As I perform a nerve storm
I prefer my pictures in word form
Bury the hatchet like how a bird born
As I paint cold pictures like Kool-Aid facing condensation
Having conversations with flavorful combinations
Slave to my concentration
So that's OJ The Juiceman meets OJ with two hands
And two gloves, that's too snug
To judge who was, who drew blood
And, Lupe look at all these toucans
In a cemetery full of tomahawkes
Giving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults
Road runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across
Anomalies by the colonies flukes by the reservoir
Wilding pursuers end up as poofs on the desert floor
Levitating youth so know the truth of where the fountain hides
Bucaraa Roof painting tunnels onto the mountain sides
A thousands parts a pound of heart an ounce of eyes
Announcing now the doubt in mouth pronounces a count of lies
Chocula Counts by the counts of 5, refrigerator roof full of animals and monsters
Incinerated shoes and the manual for contra
Assorted memories from my childhood
Absorbing energy from the wild woods
Electronic combat Konami sign contract
Chinese char killing cucarachas on contact
Chicago spread an aficionado
Efficient spitting bridging divisions is in Chicano
Who's the Boss? If isn't Alyssa Milano
Dudikoff, ninja mission into the Congo
Polarize envy of the older guys
Black obi, shinobi hitting Kenno in the face with all my throwing knives
Sub-zero guiding, hiding, riding in the pack as well
Sound village, Leaf village, wolf spirit, magic spells
Dodging rain and catching hail
Faces need samurais to catch the L
Special research vessels made for catching whales
Fillet-a-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails
Rewrite history, liberty needs a better bell
Maybe hotter irons and carbon fibres that never fail
Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairytale
Or maybe just a metal pail that you hit with a steel tools
To announce that you've had enough and dropping out of SEAL school
Just like trout jumping out they house to let they gills cool
Cuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool
I said it feels cool to kill fools
Slipping through the cracks like when you trying to grill gruel
Take no Viking water bottle and not following pill rules
Will have you off of the throttle when you should be modeling chill mood
Roller skater maker or are you just cobbling wheel shoes
Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
Oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your meal you
Simple as a Buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot, practising stillness
Real still til he realizes his realness
Defeat Samsara achieves nirvana and brilliance, yea

Cold feet cause I'm on thin ice
It's alright besides the fact I want it all in one night
Like, you can't skip steps is the best
Even though the vets hold a .47 with a vest
Now that's a wise investment
Or a concept to try and hide divine intentions
It's like, let em hate, stay calm and meditate
When life has the lemons it's time to eliminate
More sour than lemonade, anyways
Different days, different highs, different haze
Kama Sutra with miss Mary Jane

Dessy be that suspect for subjects for all the records
Set in for all the records, I spit in a split of seconds
So you can't reckon that I wasn't checking for beats unpleasant
I eat up a track and hit your producer up for seconds
Remember I'm the face so lace me in the line
The bars that I could line up could probably bump the fine up
Define what never can judge, rap is in my blood
So much, my capularies adapted a sanctuary
From the 5th of January, every punchline turned into crunch time
Was cutting records more times than my school's lunch line
So if this hits mine, go ahead and pop your wrist fine
Been spitting dirty, the vocals recording spit shine
'Til the day I die, I'll be puffing lye, fuck the world, fuck it dry
Tell them government spies I won't cover my eyes
Won't cower, won't move cause I don't move like a coward
Knowledge is power and the flower of life is ours

And the green only made me clever
See God made three Bigs, two Pacs, but he only made one error

Ayo, Bo knows this And Bo knows that
But Bo don't know jack, 'cause Bo can't rap

Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here
My days of paying dues are over, acknowledge me as in there
Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meaning from the get-go
Sit back, relax, and let yourself go

Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag', a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
guy hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black Dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye
I have had a number of job interviews recently that went poorly and did not result in securing employment.
I started to think I needed to do something during an interview to really stand out, be impressive, unique, and highly memorable. I thought it could be risky, but might work out.
I came up with the following idea: After concluding the interview, after the hand shakes, etc, when leaving the room stop, turn around, and say There's one more thing you need to know about me.
Then pull out a bottle of hot sauce, down the entire bottle, slam it onto the ground and say I can handle the heat. Nod confidently, leave the room.
I imagined that they would be really impressed and wowed by such a performance.
Well it didn't pan out like I thought it would. It was only a small bottle of hot sauce, I figured it would be no big deal to actually do. I should have tested at home first, but I didn't.
I was nervous as a bitch-ass during the interview, but I was determined to follow through with the plan.
So I started exactly as described above. I was leaving, I turned around, maybe not with as much swagger as I'd imagined in my head, and I declared There's one more thing you need to know about me.
I pulled out the hot sauce bottle, almost dropped it, and started to open the bottle. In my head it was all one quick confident motion, like an electric Indiana Jones, but instead I fumbled around and had a tough time getting it open. It felt like a nightmarish eternity but was probably only about 20 seconds. Enough time for one of the interviewers to ask me what I was doing.
I didn't answer directly. Instead, after I got the bottle open, I repeated There's one more thing you need to know about me. But stuttering.
Then I guzzled down the entire bottle of hot sauce. I instantly regretted it. My mouth and throat felt like lava was swirling around inside me. I immediately started to gag and loudly cough, I was crying involuntarily. Tears hardcore streaming down my face. I was sweating like a terrible fool.
I desperately tried to scream I can handle the heat but just kept coughing before I could get anything out.
The interviewers were all standing up looking at me in horror and confusion.
A few seconds before I threw up all over the floor I knew it would happen, but I tried to hold it back. I couldn't.
I threw up all over the floor. It hurt as much on the way out as it did on the way in, if not more so. The vomit felt like flaming barbed wire shredding its way through my neck.
I should mention a disturbing amount of fiery mucus was also leaking out of my nose uncontrollably.
After I finished throwing up I could not bear to look at the interviewers. I hoarsely mumbled an apology and started to stumble as quickly as possible out the door.
I have never been more shamed in my life.
I didn't get the job.
I have one moment that stands out above all the rest. I was waiting for someone to ask me this question. It's the reason I left a good job as a VIP Tourguide and moved to the Character Department.
I was working City Hall one day when two guests came in with two little girls. One was in a wheel chair and the other one looked like she had just seen death. Both were cut and bruised and the one in the wheelchair had her arm in a cast. The two women were actually nurses from a hospital and were asking for a refund on the girl's tickets, something we avoided doing at all costs. When I asked why they told me the story. The two girls were with their mom and dad at Epcot and on the way home they got into a horrible car accident. The mother was beheaded right in front of them. The father eventually died too but the two girls didn't know that yet. They were from overseas and had no money and no contact information for anyone they knew. They were bringing the tickets back to get the girls some much needed money to help get them back home. My heart absolutely sunk. If you had seen these girls you'd know why. They were truly traumatized. I refunded their tickets and got permission to be their private tour guide for the rest of the day, which they were not expecting. I walked them to the VIP viewing area for the parade which was as far as I could walk them in the costume we used to wear at City Hall. I had to leave them there while I put on my VIP costume. On the way down I pulled out every kid joke I could think of. I was a REALLY good tour guide. I helped write part of it, and I knew how to make kids smile. Nothing worked. These girls were too far gone for that. I left them at the bridge to go change, walked backstage and bawled my eyes out. I just had never seen something so horrible. I was truly affected and it was a terrible feeling of powerlessness not being able to fix the situation. When I came back I brought them to get ice-cream, take them on rides and stuff but they never smiled, not once. The nurses were loving it and were trying to get them into it but it just wasn't working. We went back to the bridge to watch the parade. It was there that I honestly saw true magic. Real magic, not bullshit. I had called the parade department to let them know what was going on and set up a private meet and greet after the parade. As the parade was coming around Liberty Square I told the girls that I had called Mickey and told him all about them. I told them that Mickey asked to meet them after the parade.
The little girl in the wheelchair smiled.
Really? she asked. My heart skipped. Yes, really! He told me to tell you to look out for him in the parade and to follow the float back to City Hall.
The other girl smiled.
You mean right now? she asked.
It had worked. They were talking. Not laughing, but talking. It was the first time I had heard them speak. Every single parade performer came up to them on the bridge and told them to look out for Mickey. Every one of them told them that. When Mickey's float came up Mickey, who was attached to a pole at the top of the float, managed to turn her body sideways, look down at the girls and point towards Main Street. That was all it took. The girls were excited now. They had forgotten about death. They were lost in a magical world and I couldn't believe I was watching it unfold in front of my eyes. We followed that float all the way back to City Hall, singing Mickey Mania the whole way. Back then, City Hall used to have a VIP lounge behind the desk that was for privacy during difficult situations or to host celebrities. I took them in and showed them the book where all of the autographs were. They were eating it up.
The girl who was Mickey that day got down off her float and without even taking her head off walked up to me backstage and said Let's go. I walked in with Mickey behind me so I got to see the exact moment the girls met their new friend. They got shy but Mickey was in control now. Those girls met the REAL Mickey Mouse that day. Every single parade character stayed dressed to meet those girls. One by one they'd come in and play a bit then leave. We were in that lounge for over an hour. Mickey stayed in costume the entire time, which is hard to do after a parade. When Mickey finally said goodbye I had two excited girls on my hands that couldn't stop smiling. They talked and talked and talked. We had a wonderful day after that but what I remember most is when we walked by the rose garden, the older one said Oh, my mommy loves roses! I mean... and she stopped. I held out my hand and walked her to the gate, picked her up and put her on the other side and said Pick one! She looked happy as she picked out her favorite rose. She didn't say anything more and she didn't need to. I said goodbye to the wonderful nurses and the wonderful girls then walked backstage behind the train station. This time I didn't cry. It felt so good to be a part of that. I realized that as much as I liked helping guests at City Hall, the true magic of Disney was in the character department. I auditioned, transferred and never looked back. Thanks for letting me relive this. It was a special day for me.
As a man that has reached the ripe old age of 48 I can promise you I have seen some shit go down. This one totally takes the cake for me though.
I was waiting out front of a truck stop back in the mid 80's. Sitting on a park bench with a guy that had a big Rottweiler kinda dog on a leash with him. I tried to make small talk but he was quite a sourpuss. So we sat in silence for a few minutes until the most unexpected thing I have ever seen, happened right before my very eyes.
While we were sitting there a big 18 wheeler pulls in without a trailer so he parks right up front like a normal car would. Inside the cab of the truck with the driver is a little monkey. The dance for the organ grinder kind. I think they are called Rhesus monkeys perhaps. Well the dog spots this lil monkey and proceeds to go apeshit over it. Lunging at the end of his leash and barking at the top of his lungs. Generally making a real spectacle of himself to say the least.
The driver is obviously upset, but not nearly as much as the monkey is. Actually upset may be the wrong adjective to use for the monkey though. In retrospect I think eagerly aggressive may be a more appropriate description for his disposition. He was pacing the dashboard back and forth. Never taking his eyes off of this very aggravating dog.
The driver opens his little triangle window that they don't make on cars anymore. The ones made for smokers back in the day. He yells out to this douche bag to call his dog off because it is upsetting his monkey. The guy laughs and says no way! I told you he was a jerk didn't I? Says that his dog is not bothering nobody. The dog hasn't shut up since he laid eyes on the monkey. I promise you he is bothering everybody for several blocks around.
Now here's where things start to get interesting. The driver says that if he doesn't call his dog off he's gonna let his monkey loose on that dog. Douche bag laughs and says that his dog would eat that monkey alive. Upon hearing this the driver leans over and reaches into his glove box I guess. Pulls out one of those tiny baseball bats like you used to get at Astroworld or carnivals, and places it in the monkeys hand. The monkey obviously knows what's about to go down because he is now trying to squeeze out of that little triangular window I mentioned earlier. This monkey has murder in his eyes if I have ever seen it. Driver hollers Last chance to save your dog's ass man. In response douche bag lets his dog off of the leash. Now we have a situation that has escalated to the point where we have a dog jumping up at the window and a monkey screaming profanities right back at him. Well, the driver finally rolls down the regular window and out leaps all kinds of miniature primate hell. The dog never knew what hit him. Quick as a flash this monkey is riding on the back of this dog's neck. His two back feet all wrapped up in his neck fur with one hand hanging onto an ear. The other hand as you may have guessed by now is steadily and mercilessly raining down blows about this dog's head and face. I mean hard blows. You can hear them whap whap whap.
Well it only took a moment for the dog to realize he was in way over his head. He bolts yelping bloody murder as he runs away at full speed. I mean this dog is running so fuckin hard he's throwing up tufts of grass and dirt as soon as he leaves pavement. The monkey still riding him and beating on him the whole time. Douche bag acts like he wants to fight now but several people including myself stepped in to stop that nonsense. In a couple of minutes or so the little monkey comes loping back with his little bat still in hand, and leaps up into the still open window of the truck to await his master who has gone on into the store.
That wanker ran off to try to go find his dog, but I don't know if he ever did. My ride showed up and I had to go. Never again in this lifetime will I see something so totally crazy and unexpected like that. I am both fortunate and humble to have been so privileged to be present for such an event.
So Reddit, please do tell. What's your craziest thing you have ever seen in public?
Let me tell you that I have made a bad mistake this evening.
My girlfriend, who let me tell you is only my 2nd girlfriend of all time, said I am invited to dinner with her and her parents. I was very aghast, nervous, and bashful to be invited to such a situation. But I knew it must be done.
I met them nicely, I should tell you, and it started off in a good way. The idea slapped my mind that I should do a comic bit, to make a good impression and become known to them as a person who is amusing.
When I saw that baked potatoes were served I got the idea that it would be very good if I pretended I did not know what potatoes was. That would be funny.
Well let me tell you: backfired on my face. I'll tell you how.
So first when the potato became on my plate, I acted very interesting. I showed an expression on my face so as to seem that I was confused, astounded but in a restrained way, curious, and interested. They did notice, and seemed confused, but did not remark. So I asked This looks very interesting. What is this?
They stared at me and the mother said It's a baked potato. And I was saying Oh, interesting, a baked....what is it again?
And she was like A potato.
And I was like A 'potato', oh interesting. Never heard of a potato, looks pretty good.
And then they didn't see I was clowning, but thought I really did not know what is a potato. So I knew I would be very shamed, humiliated, depressed, and disgusted if I admitted to making a bad joke, so what I did was to act as if it was not a joke but I committed to the act of pretending I didn't know what a potato is.
They asked me, VERY incredulous, did I really not know what a potato is? That I never heard of a potato. I went with it and told them, yes, I did not ever even hear of a potato. Not only had I never eaten a potato I had never heard the word potato.
This went on for a bit and my girlfriend was acting very confused and embarrassed by my fucked up antics, and then the more insistent I was about not knowing what a potato is was when them parents starting thinking I DID know what a potato was.
Well let me tell you I had to commit 100% at this point. When I would not admit to knowing what a potato was, the father especially began to get annoyed. At one point he said something like Enough is enough. You're fucking with us. Admit it. And I said Sir, before today I never heard of a potato. I still don't know what a potato is, other than some kind of food. I don't know what to tell you.
Well let me tell you he got very annoyed. I decided to take a bite of the potato, and when I did I made a high pitched noise and said Taste's very strange!
That is when the father started yelling at me, and the mother kept saying What are you doing? and my girlfriend went to some other room.
Finally the father said I should Get the fuck out of his house and I said it was irrational to treat me like this just because I never heard of a potato before. Well let me tell you he didn't take that kindly.
Now in text messages I have been telling my girlfriend I really don't know what a potato is. The only way I can ever get out of this is for them to buy that I don't know what a potato is.
I wish I never started it but I can't go back. I think she will break up with me anyway.
Healthy food is relative to your dietary needs, for one. Avoid Organic. That's just overpriced dirtier vegetables you'll have to run more water to wash more thoroughly.
One thing to point out when you're low income and scrounging money for food: Your social and political ideologies really are not important when you are struggling to survive. If you don't like how X brand does things, but they're the cheapest option, you're going to have to suck it up until you can afford to protest with your wallet. That's something people with money get to do. Not people that are struggling for food and survival.
Remember: Convenience is expensive. If it's pre-prepped, you're paying for someone else to do the work. If you're low income, you will be doing the work yourself. If you don't know how to do something manually, use Youtube and look it up.
Find out when the manager's specials are on meats. My grocery store marks meats down on Wednesdays. I buy in bulk, repack, butcher whole chickens, cut "steaks" from cheap roasts, whatever I can get on sale, I process it into how I will use it, and shove it in the freezer.
Plan your meals and stick to serving sizes. Scour the sales ads beforehand plan your menu around what you can get on the cheap. Google recipes if you have to.
Get a notebook and PLAN out what you will be making for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Write out the ingredients. Monday breakfast: Eggs, toast, and oatmeal. Protein, carbs, long-lasting energy source. Figure out how many of that item you will need.
Take stock of what you already have in the house. Whatever you don't have that you need for that week's food, add it to the grocery list. Buy ONLY what is on your grocery list. If the kids cause a ruckus at the store because they want treats, this is a good time to teach your kids the word No and how to view candy and sweets and junk food as treats, not common snacks.
This is also a great opportunity to teach your kids how to budget. That's not the school's job, that's your job as a parent. Give the kid a calculator and have them keep track of a running total with you. Have them help you make these lists and pick and cook these meals. Teach them young so they will have these skills as adults. Kids are more apt to eat and like food they helped prepare.
Shop with cash. If your income is low enough, apply for food assistance. Screw all of the political bullshit. None of those people that demonize food assistance have problems affording food. Where I live, it's loaded on a card and you swipe it like any debit card. Fuck people's opinions, fuck your pride and ego, fuck politics. If you can't afford food, apply for assistance. I used to work on the issuance end of that. It's insane how many people were so embarrassed and ashamed to be applying for assistance because they wanted to feed their kids something more than rice and beans every night but everyone around them acted like "those" people were lazy scum. They had income. Sometimes two incomes. It just wasn't enough to be above government poverty standards. Unemployment and underemployment is sky-high regardless of the official numbers. Those numbers only count the people on unemployment, nothing more. The worst they can tell you is no. You are the one responsible for feeding yourself and your family, you do whatever you need to do get food.
If your income is low enough, see if there's a school lunch program for the kids.
Frozen vegetables are great to have if your fresh vegetables don't last long. Frozen corn, frozen peas, frozen carrots, frozen broccoli. They are frozen fresh, so they are good, and they last a while. Sautee them in a pan with a bit of oil or butter and add garlic salt. They taste really nice. Don't visibly balk at food you don't like if you have impressionable children. They learn from their parents what they decide doesn't taste good until they're a bit older. The less picky they are, the more room you have to be varied in your food.
Slow cooker meals. Buy big cuts of meat and use a slow cooker. You're going to be doing most of the food work now, so let a safe machine do it for you once in a while. Plop a chuck roast in there with some potatoes, carrots, and onions. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder and some herbs like rosemary or thyme cook on low. Roast dinner ready in 8 hours. Dump a bunch of chicken leg quarters in there and some enchilada sauce and diced onion. Shred the chicken off the bone when you get home and mix it with the sauce, remove the bones. Plop that meat into some tortillas for less-fuss tacos. Cabbage is cheap and adds a fun texture to tacos. You can even get purple cabbage to amuse the kids. Shred a bit of that up, plop it in the taco with the meat, add cheese you shredded from a big block yourself. Slow cooker recipes are plentiful online.
Leftovers for lunch. It will get boring. Get used to it. Along with that--no second helpings. If someone's still hungry, they get a full glass of water to drink first then they have to wait. We eat too fast and don't let our bodies register being full most of the time. Slow down, talk to the family over dinner. Ask how everyone's day is going and what they did. Conversation takes time away from eating so you feel full by the end of dinner.
If you're still low on money and don't have enough, seek out local churches and see if they have any food programs or know of any resources.
My sister has been awake occasionally, breathing on her own, but she has an infection in her heart and needs a transplant most likely. She was a drug user. She had a stroke and was on a ventilator but they took it out ten days ago as weel as the feedtu e, thinking she wouldn't make it, but she has. She's talked a little bit, said my name, thanked the pastor for coming, asked for the TV to be changed to her favorite channel. I don't want her to keep starving to death. They also stopped treating her infection and she's currently only on morphine and a medicine to stop the mucus from building in her lungs. She has a pulmonary embolism as well. She can't eat because she's aspirating and they say her heart isn't getting fluids to the right places, so she's not on fluids either. She looks like a corpse, she's lost so much weight in these ten days.
It's perfectly normal to expect your sister to be starving to death, and to want to give her something to eat. It's what your own eyes and ears are telling you, plain as day, right? It's also something that has been ingrained in us since we were really young, that when you get sick, you need food to help you feel better, like chicken noodle soup when you have a cold or flu.
The brain tells the body that it has enough food, thanks but no more. The brain already knows that it has enough energy to last. When a body is dying, the body no longer needs energy, so it sends a message to the brain = no more food! And that dying person will as a consequence have no appetite for food. They know on a cellular level that food is really just energy and they have all the energy they need. The brain will start shutting down the stomach and the digestive system soon because with no food there's no reason to operate the digestive system. The brain will also take care of pain in these last few hours and keep her comfortable. And then the brain will move onto other body systems, just as a matter of the body shutting down.
Now sometimes a person has more energy than the brain realized they had and so the brain will let them burn it off really fast. This happens sometimes, the dying person will wake up and feel really good! They won't feel pain, they feel great! Sometimes they even get up and dance around. Sometimes they feel hungry for something really specific like a McDonald's burger or a chocolate milkshake. In these cases, please get them whatever they are asking for. They will feel alright for a while. And able to eat and talk and seemingly full of energy. It's just the body burning off excess energy, but it is also a last gift to you, to spend that time with you. Sometimes it comes and goes really fast, sometimes it lasts for a few hours. But likely their body will catch up to them, and they will start to feel really weak and sleepy, and then they may pass away shortly.
Sometimes patients may pass away with you or other family members in the room. I always tried to get the family to tell the patient that "it's okay to go." Because the patient may feel confused, not sure that they should go, particularly if there's unfinished business. The dying may also see family or friends who have gone before them waiting there in the room.
The kindest thing you can do is to hold their hand and talk to them, talk about pleasant memories, tell them it's okay to go, if they talk about someone who has already passed, talk to them about that person.`.replace(
